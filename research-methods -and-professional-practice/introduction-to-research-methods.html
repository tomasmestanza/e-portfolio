                    </h3>
                    <p>AI presents an exciting evolution. The concepts exposed in (Deckard, 2023) in relation to the
                        interdisciplinary nature of AI and its fast development make it very complex to understand and
                        compile its implications in terms of ethics, establish the limits and deal with the different
                        approaches used around the world, to deal with the ethical implications. According to (Liu et
                        al.,
                        2018), the first ideas of an artificial brain were present as early as the 1940s. Passing
                        through
                        the "AI winter" from 1987 to 1993, the field of AI research and industry has witnessed
                        significant
                        growth (Correa et al., 2024). However, the development of AI has had a growing trend at the
                        beginning of the new century, appearing more institutionalised. This growth is affecting
                        multiple
                        areas and bringing up different challenges.</p>

                    <p>In this growing trend, a critical question is the definition of ethical premises to support the
                        development of AI technologies. The aim of developing ethics to guide the development and
                        implementation of AI technologies is that their design and use are done in a fair, transparent
                        and
                        responsible way (Deckard, 2023). Making this a global phenomenon will encounter several
                        challenges
                        as countries will act in different ways in front of the same ethical situation. The absence of
                        effective mechanisms to enforce the principle of Ethics in AI is another problem that has not
                        been
                        sorted, and the repetitive losses result in insufficient as a consequence of not complying with
                        the
                        ethics principles (Hagendorff, 2020).</p>

                    <p>There is a lot to do to develop the principles and techniques of AI ethics. Even though AI ethics
                        is
                        still in its early stages despite being extensively researched by interdisciplinary researchers
                        for
                        several years (Huang et al., 2022). However, it is also essential to develop appropriate
                        enforcement
                        mechanisms to start approaching the development of an international standard that could properly
                        work towards developing AI, taking into account its risks for everyone involved in developing
                        and
                        consuming the results of AI.</p>

                    <p>As per the development of confidentiality and security compliance guides, leading organisations
                        will
                        have an important role in creating standards that can guide other countries and make them adopt
                        these suggested standards. Ethical principles already exist in large quantities, but how many of
                        those can be applied globally or adopted by governments of all countries? This is an important
                        question exposed in (Correa et al., 2023). It is essential to mention the global initiative for
                        ethical considerations in the design of autonomous and intelligent systems. This IEEE initiative
                        provides platforms to bring together and give voices to hundreds of thousands of scientists and
                        experts around the world, making it possible to discuss and analyse the ethics in all fields
                        relative to autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS) (IEEE SA, 2022).</p>

                    <p>There will always be a unique component in each different country or society, so in our opinion,
                        an
                        expectation to have a 100% effective framework should not be including in the results of it
                        application. Development ethics must consider such claims and questions of cultural plurality
                        and
                        divergence (Gasper, 1996).</p>

                    <p>A resultant framework that could give the development and implementation of AI in accordance to
                        common ethics principles taking into account the common aspects of ethics in this pluricultural
                        world. Bringing together and including all the specific aspects of ethics around the world is
                        another challenge. The development of moral codes in society is also affected by time, which
                        brings
                        another parameter of complexity to the analysis. Instead, the new framework should focus on the
                        common ethical rules present around the world. Here, we can clearly see that it will not be
                        possible
                        to satisfy the requirements of every culture, but in our opinion, it is what is more proximal to
                        a
                        solution. Based on these common ethical rules, it is possible to extrapolate and create a
                        framework
                        as effectively as possible.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>Understanding the implications (function) of the device under discussion is important to assess
                        if Corazon took essential recommendations and followed standards when releasing their device
                        into the market. According to (Cheung et al., 2024), implantable cardiac monitors are meant to
                        monitor the rhythm of the heart for extended periods of time and transmit data remotely to
                        clinicians. From the previous concept, we understand that the accuracy and privacy of data are
                        essential elements of this analysis.</p>

                    <p>Corazon uses standard encryption algorithms to transmit the data which tells us the level of
                        care and compliance to security standards. The good approach when receiving feedback on
                        potential vulnerabilities and commitment to run investigations in order to mitigate the effects
                        of the found vulnerability is also another way of showing us their commitment to security.</p>

                    <p>Regarding compliance with the BCS, when defining limited capabilities for the device, Corazon
                        showed that was willing to take responsibilities for its performance and the transmission of
                        data.</p>

                    <p>Also, when a vulnerability was found, understanding the functionality and the aim of the device
                        was important to deem the potential harm as negligible because of the limited capability of the
                        device.</p>

                    <p>The table below summarises the coincidences between the analysis of the ACM Code of Ethics and
                        the BSC Code of conduct. The four principles of the BSC are You make IT for everyone, Show what
                        you know, learn what you don’t, Respect the organisation or individual you work for, and Keep IT
                        real. Keep IT professional. Pass IT on (BSC, N.D.).</p>
