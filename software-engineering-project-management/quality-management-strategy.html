                    <h3 class="bold-h3">e-Portfolio Activity: Improving Code Quality. Refer to the Mertz (2019)
                        resource. Use some Python code which you have developed in the past and apply at least 3 of the
                        strategies presented at the source to improve its quality.
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        For this exercise, I will use a project I wrote in the first module of this course. Using
                        Pylint, Flake8 on VScode,
                        I will apply the three recommendations stated by Mertz (2019).
                    </p>

                    <p>Part 1</p>
                    <p>After running Pylint on the python file, several suggestions were listed, including unnecessary
                        elses, variables that didn't comply with the snake_case naming style, unused variables,
                        importing libraries that should be at the top of the script, etc.</p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="../images/module5/initial-pylint-run.png">
                    </p>
                    <p>After applying the recommendations from Pylint, the file looks like the below image.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../images/module5/after-pylint.png">
                    </p>

                    <p>After running using flake8, the errors were more specific and more strict. Block comments should
                        start with '#', at least two spaces before the inline comment, line too long (80 > 79
                        characters), expected
                        two blank lines, etc.</p>

                    <p>All of these recommendations were applied and the file looked like the below image.</p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="../images/module5/after-flake8.png">
                    </p>

                    <p>Automated tools allow us to write clean code, respecting the standards and complying with best
                        coding practices.</p>

                    <p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
                    <p>Docstring and comment formatting were applied in the previous step as part of applying flake8.
                    </p>


                    <p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>

                    <p>For this simple project, I have structured the files as shown in the screenshot below. A test
                        file and a readme file were added.</p>

                    </h3>

                    <p>The IEEE defines Quality as the group of characteristics of a product or service that
                        represents
                        its ability to satisfy a specific need. </p>

                    <p>A quantitative measure of an attribute that affects software quality is called a quality metric.
                    </p>

                    <p>The achievement of levels of quality is the responsibility of the project manager.</p>

                    <p>The additional work that has to be done due to taking a shortcut solution is called technical
                        debt.</p>

                    <p>Time cost and quality are the constraints to take into account (triple constraints)</p>

                    <p><strong>PMI</strong></p>

                    <p>A situation of a quality output that avoids the technical debt within the triple constraints
                        needs
                        monitoring to achieve quality metrics that can allow the application of corrective actions if
                        needed.</p>

                    <p>As quality is relative, the attributes and ways to measure the quality have to be previously
                        agreed
                        upon with the client to apply tests that can indicate that the quality has been achieved.</p>

                    <p>According to PMI, quality management has three perspectives: quality planning, quality assurance,
                        and quality control.</p>

                    <p>Quality planning. During the quality planning stage, identify the appropriate quality metrics.
                    </p>

                    <p>Quality assurance. Monitor all processes, methods and activities and ensure they comply with the
                        defined standards.</p>

                    <p>Quality control. Activities to evaluate if the product meets the quality requirements. Validate
                        the deliverables and satisfy the stakeholder's quality requirements.</p>


                    <p><strong>ISO/IEC 25010</strong></p>

                    <p>This standard includes six characteristics of quality (recommendation 9126): functionality,
                        reliability, effectiveness, usability, maintainability and portability.</p>

                    <p>In recommendation 25010, ISO / IEC includes eight characteristics of quality. Functional
                        Suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security,
                        maintainability and portability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Quality Management Models</strong></p>

                    <p>The quality management model by McAll (1977) includes eleven characteristics. Integrity,
                        reliability, usability, accuracy, efficiency, maintainability, testability, flexibility,
                        interoperability, reusability and portability. The matrix considered by this author includes
                        product
                        revision (testing), product transition (adaptation to changes) and product operations (user
                        experience).</p>

                        <strong>
                            Please answer the following questions:


                        </strong>
                    </p>

                    <p> Why do you think that so many frameworks have evolved around the concept of quality metric
                        definition?</p>

                    <p>As the quality can be relative, the models evolve to cover the relativity and the dynamism of the
                        characteristics that define quality. Measuring the quality is the ultimate way of determining if
                        the
                        quality of the product or service matches the expectations of the stakeholders. This way, the
                        models
                        can be more precise and help managers manage the quality of a project more accurately.</p>

                    <p>Which one is the current one?</p>

                    <p>As it is constantly updated, the EFQM is the currently most recognised management framework to
                        support quality (EFQM, N.D.).</p>

                    <p>Which one(s) is applicable to agile methodologies?</p>

                    <p>EFQM allows the continuation of Agile practices, as the processes are continuously analysed and
                        optimised (Mooncamp, 2022). Agile can also integrate into ISO 9001.</p>

                    <p>Which one do you consider to be the most suitable, and why?</p>
                    <p>EFQM is globally recognised; its newest version is 2020, which means it is permanently updated.
                        It
                        is based on five enablers that are very important: leadership, policy and strategy, people,
                        partnership and resources, and processes. It is based on simple but powerful logic. It allows us
                        to
                        drive performance and, at the same time, remain agile, adaptive and able to evolve (EFQM, N.D.).
                    </p>
