                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        In my initial post, I highlighted the importance of the method used by the article's authors
                        under discussion. Root Cause Analysis is used to find common elements between the causes of
                        failure being studied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also highlighted the software process improvement (SPI) concept, which aims to lower costs and
                        reduce time to market while improving software quality. One of my fellow students agreed with
                        the importance of this concept but added the existence of a content team within the
                        organisation, as a condition for its implementation. Although I agree that a good software
                        product has to balance efficiency, reliability and maintainability, what I understand from the
                        authors is that the focus would be on improving the process as ways of working rather than
                        restricting the final product to just being efficient. Having said that, I consider the
                        recommendation for having a content team to be valid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on my experience, the top reason for project failure is
                        Chaotic environment. Another of my fellow students agreed with this and suggested improving
                        communication to avoid this issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The example cases BSkyB and EDS CRM (chaotic environment) and Ariane 501 (lack of relevant
                        skills) were also highlighted as correct examples of lack of communication and failure to
                        understand specifications, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarise, I found the use of categories for project failure causes to be very beneficial as
                        they allow us to organise them and then recognise them. This knowledge will help us to avoid
                        them or mitigate them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Read the articles by Verner et al (2014) and Anton & Nucu (2020) and then answer the
                            following questions:<br>
                            1. What are the main risks that the authors identify?<br>
                            2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 Lecturecast would you use to capture
                            and
                            categorise the risks?<br>
                            3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module forum. </strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the first article, the authors study global software development and the literature
                        review
                        about GSD, to discover if the systematic literature review can provide helpful advice on
                        risk
                        and risk mitigation to organisations that directly or indirectly deal with DSG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The authors recognise that the primary motivations for GSD are to reduce the time-to-market
                        and
                        access more resources at a low cost, therefore, to gain or preserve competitive advantage.
                        However, the authors also consider that these motivations would not be achievable without
                        managing the risks through the software life cycle (SDLC).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The increase in complexity (due to the size of the projects and global development),
                        increases
                        risk. Here are included time, culture, organisational and distance between stakeholders. All
                        these are summarised in deficient communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other risks mentioned by the authors are coordination, control and infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Answer 1</strong></p>
                    <p>In different categories, and talking about GSD, the main risks are</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Vendor’s poor infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Lack of project management skills to choose a vendor</li>
                        <li>National, organisational, and cultural differences (loss of data, confusion, etc)</li>

                        <li>Differences in processes, policies, and standards</li>
                        <li>Lack of well-defined modules (issues with progressive integration)</li>
                        <li>Language differences (misinterpretation of information)</li>
                        <li>Lack of training in communication and collaboration tools</li>
                        <li>Limited face-to-face-meetings (difficulties in building collaboration)</li>
                        <li>Peoples management and conflict resolution</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Most risks are related to Human Resources and project management skills. Within these,
                        communication and collaboration appears as the most common risk.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer 2</strong></p>

                    <p>The two frameworks I find relevant to categorising risk are <br><br>
                        1. The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE). <br>It
                        allows
                        organisations to identify and manage information security risks. Offers a broad method for
                        evaluation that shows the assets that can be under threat. This relationship between
                        assets-risk-vulnerabilities allows organisations to understand what is at risk and,
                        therefore,
                        design a mitigation strategy (Albert, et. al, 1999).<br><br>

                        With this framework, a set of risks is produced and prioritised according to their impact
                        and
                        probability.<br><br>

                        2. Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR). <br>As an international standard, it offers a
                        quantitative approach model for information security and operational risk (FAIR Institute,
                        N.D.). It is important to understand cyber risks and operational risks from a financial
                        point of
                        view.<br><br>

                        This framework provides a scalable risk model with a standard categorisation for information
                        and
                        operational risks.</p>

                        <strong>TC = Tp+Td+Tt+Ts</strong><br><br>

                        T is the total time allowed for the project

                        <li>Td = development time (T/6).</li>
                        <li>Tt = Testing time (T/6).</li>
                        <li>Ts = System test time (T/4).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Brooks (1975) also provides other 2 equations</p>

                    <ul class="list">

                        <li>Nopt = 1.41*(MMn/MMc)½ - To calculate the optimum number of developers, use this
                            equation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><u>COCOMO</u></p>
                    <p>Constructive Cost Model by Boehm (1981), it is based in number of lines of code</p>

                    <p>Presents 3 categories</p>

                    <p>Organic, semi detached , and embedded</p>

                    <p><strong>Organic: </strong>Small teams, in-house, work on well defined projects<br>
                        <strong>Semi detached:</strong> Depending on complexity or approach, it is intermediate to
                        organic and embedded.<br>
                        <strong>Embedded: </strong>Software and hardware complexity, operates within defined
                        constraints
                    </p>

                    <p>COCOMO is rarely used today.</p>

                    <p><u>Expert Judgement method</u></p>

                    <p>By far the most used estimation method. Based on previous experience, they produce estimates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For new projects, it assumes an in-house set of developers, as well as the similarity with
                        previous
                        projects and how successful the previous project was. </p>


                    <p><strong>Risk Management Frameworks</strong></p>

                    <p>

                        Open FAIR - a framework produced by the Open Group<br>
                        The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE). Framework
                        standard created at Carnegie Mellon University
                        (CMU)</p>


                    <p><u>The Process to Manage Risk</u></p>

                    <p>Campbell (2016) recommends the production of a risk register that collects and collates risks
                        from
                        as wide a variety of sources as possible, such as gathering data from:</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Risk notification mailboxes (will need to be qualified and quantified)</li>
                        <li>Threat workshops</li>
                        <li>Business impact assessments</li>
                        <li>Gap analysis</li>
                        <li>Security audits</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After gathering risks, the next step is to analyse them. I understand that quantitative
                        assessment
                        could ignore risks that can not be quantified
                        due to their subjective nature. So, both types of assessments are required. Qualitative
                        (minor.
                        Medium, major)</p>

                    <p>After analysis, the next phase is the risk mitigation. This is where each Risk is classified
                        as
                        being in one of four categories:</p>

                    <p><strong>Eliminate</strong>(i.e. should it be removed or avoided altogether).</p>

                    <p><strong>Tolerate</strong> (where Risk is recorded but no other action is taken, usually due
                        to a
                        cost-benefit
                        analysis).</p>

                    <p><strong>Reduce</strong> (where the impact of a risk is minimised by preventative action).</p>

                    <p><strong>Transfer</strong> (where the cost of mitigation and or impact of a risk is shared
                        between
                        multiple
                        stakeholders).</p>

                    <p>Once a risk has been classified, there are a number of mitigation mechanisms available.
                        Primarily,
                        these consist of the following:</p>

                    <p> Physical controls (CCTV), procedural controls (training), and technical controls
                        (firewalls).
                        These
                        three all together can make Preventative Controls.</p>
