                <h2>Final reflections on the module</h2>

                <div class="skills_holder">
                    <p>1089 words</p>
                    <h3 class="bold-h3"><strong>What</strong></h3>

                    <p>After finalising module 4, where we studied the concepts of Information Security, Risk Management
                        and Risk Assessment, this module presented a critical topic: Software Engineering Project
                        Management
                        (SEPM).</p>

                    <p>The Software Engineering Project Management module reviews the fundamental concepts of SEPM and
                        introduces other concepts like Behaviour-driven Development (BDD). This module introduces the
                        traditional tools used in project management, including estimating, planning, and scheduling, as
                        well as those of software architecture and engineering disciplines (University of Essex, N.D.).
                    </p>

                    <p>This is one of the most important modules and one of the reasons I enrolled in this course.
                        Initially, I felt the need to clarify to myself
                        what being a project manager means, as sometimes, at work, we manage small projects, but this
                        does
                        not give us the entire understanding of the role. How much of what we do at work is done
                        following
                        current trends? What are the most used models and techniques? How do we concatenate estimating,
                        planning and risk? These were some of the questions I had at the beginning of the module.</p>

                    <h3 class="bold-h3 "><strong>So What?</strong></h3>

                    <p><strong>Module content & tools</strong></p>


                    <p>To start, we went through the fundamental concepts of project management and established the
                        differences with SEPM. The essential aspects were gaining knowledge on the importance of SEPM
                        and
                        what certifications I could acquire as a project manager. The relationship between project
                        management and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is another critical topic, as the SDLC
                        needs to be wrapped up by project management.</p>

                    <p>We opened with a discussion on why a software project can fail. This discussion was beneficial as
                        it
                        allowed me to learn from different cases what the most common reasons for project failure are.
                        Lack
                        of proper communication and misunderstanding of the requirements were the most common reasons,
                        and
                        our fellow students and I agreed during the discussion. It is essential to consider these
                        reasons
                        when managing projects and avoid falling into the issues that lead these projects to fail.</p>

                    <p>Knowing the issues that can cause projects to fail, the next step was to learn about how to
                        mitigate
                        the effects of these reasons using the most adequate techniques. In my understanding, it is not
                        possible to avoid issues, so a way to mitigate their effects becomes a key responsibility of the
                        project manager to plan and apply the mitigations.</p>

                    <p>I found that the Gherkin language and its application are only one element of behaviour-driven
                        Development (BDD). BDD was a concept I saw before but never stopped to analyse and understand
                        properly. BDD is business-driven, and its benefit is noticed when the users interact with an
                        interface to the application (Behaviour Driven Development, 2020).</p>

                    <p>The importance of TDD lies in the interaction between technical and non-technical teams. This
                        interaction requires a natural way (natural language) of describing requirements; Gherkin
                        language
                        helps with this purpose. If we get all stakeholders involved, there are more chances that the
                        final
                        product will satisfy all of them.</p>

                    <p>The most challenging part of this module was, without a doubt, the project estimation. Initially,
                        I
                        needed to clarify how I would perform these activities (estimation, plan, and risk management).
                        However, I then noticed some familiar concepts I studied in my first university degree, like
                        COCOMO
                        or Expert Judgment. The benefit of this module lies in the resources it provides to do
                        activities
                        that are hands-on, like cost estimation. Going through the historical estimation methods and
                        learning about frameworks for risk assessment, like Open FAIR, provided the knowledge to
                        position
                        ourselves better when choosing appropriate tools to support our work as project managers.</p>

                    <p>There was a connection between the content from the previous module, where Risk Management and
                        Information Security were studied. I used this knowledge as a base to understand the new
                        concepts of
                        this third unit.</p>

                    <p>Using Linters to monitor code quality was reassuring because we used them in the third module,
                        where
                        I focused on using Pylint and Flake8. It feels complementary to use other tools like Pyflake,
                        Pycodestyle and Pydocstyle.</p>

                    <p><strong>Working in a team</strong></p>



                    <p>Although in my previous experience within a team, we achieved good results and work was fairly
                        shared between all members of the group, there were times when things were over-discussed and
                        ended
                        in meetings that lasted around 2 hours. Being more practical, I wanted to go straight to the
                        discussion of the interesting points and start working.</p>

                    <p>After the first meeting, I was pleased all team members were really committed to doing a good job
                        and were always present for the online meetings. We held meetings every Wednesday for the first
                        part
                        of the project, and for the second part, we also met on Sundays, being these meetings a bit
                        shorter
                        in duration.</p>

                    <p>For the first part of the project, my contribution was the definition of the scope and the
                        Gherkin
                        scenarios for the software specifications. We quickly identified software and hardware
                        requirements,
                        continued with the costing, and elaborated on the plan. As in my previous experience, getting
                        everyone involved in all activities dropped productivity a bit; this time, we were only informed
                        about our progress during the meetings held.</p>

                    <p>Using project management tools like Confluence, collaboration with Slack, and instant
                        communication
                        with WhatsApp resulted in a productive way of working.</p>

                    <p>For the second part, I analysed the new requirements so we could update the proposal for building
                        a
                        new machine. This analysis was done quicker than expected because, in the project descriptions,
                        the
                        buyer company sent their own list of requirements, so adding this to the original specifications
                        did
                        not take long.</p>





                    <h3 class="bold-h3 "><strong>Now what?</strong></h3>

                    <p>At work, I have been taking ownership of some small projects, and I have applied some of the
                        project
                        management principles. When starting this module, I expected to study these principles further
                        and
                        obtain a schematic of the activities and responsibilities of a Software Project Manager (SPM).
                        To
                        have a map of how to approach a project as a manager is essential. This map is one of the most
                        important things I gained during this module, and I will be using it when the time to
                        confidently
                        take on large projects arrives.</p>

                    <p>On monitoring quality, Pylint can give suggestions that all other tools we used in this module
                        can,
                        and it is clear that they can be used together as each of them can contribute with specific and
                        detailed suggestions. This is an important outcome I plan to apply at work.</p>

                    <p>Each time we start a new module, my aim is to update my knowledge and gain future trends. This is
                        happening, and overall, I am satisfied with the knowledge I am acquiring.</p>
