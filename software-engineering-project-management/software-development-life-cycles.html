                    <p>
                        <strong>Read Dicheva & Hodge (2018). Think about an online system which you use on a daily
                            basis.
                            Consider how it might operate at the back-end using data structures. This will inform our
                            discussion during next week’s seminar.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>The main insights I found in the article by Dicheva & Hodge (2018) are. </p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>When teaching data structures using computers and active learning, teaching must be adapted
                            to the nature of computing and the new generations.</li>

                        <li>Educational games are a type of active learning. It stimulate the learning process of
                            different
                            computing disciplines. N data structure, the number of educational games available is very
                            little.</li>

                        <li>This lack of educational tools to learn dat structures motivated the author. To develop the
                            Stack
                            Game.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Jira (Data structures)</strong></p>

                    <p>Tasks or Tickets: Could use lists to have tickets organised and can be sortable. Tickets can have
                        status and can be assigned to a user.</p>

                    <p>In Jira, the statuses could be stored in an array pre-manipulation. The status of a user is not
                        something that could change often (enable, disable, blocked).</p>

                    <p>In the comments part, do Undo/Redo can be managed with stacks. Following the principle of last
                        in,
                        first out, it makes easy to go back or forward through the text changes.</p>

                    <p>In the same comments section, the comments can be organised using a queue according to the date
                        they
                        are created. This has to be preserved when using the views to show the end user all the list of
                        messages.</p>

                        <strong>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2: Scanning Exercise and Results (Summary
                            Post)</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The article by (Minge & Thuering) analysed the perception of products and emotions in the early
                        phases of using those products. The perception of product qualities and the emotions produced
                        when
                        using the product are part of a holistic perspective of the UX.
                    </p>
                    <p>As I agree with Trevor in terms of the CUE model not being easy to read and understand (Woodman,
                        2023), I suggested other factors that affect the perception and also suggested how to
                        incorporate
                        them into the existing model. Being simple to understand is only sometimes a sign of efficiency.
                        So,
                        at the same time, the model could be improved on both fronts, readability and incorporating
                        sub-elements that affect the key concept of perception.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another important concept that we have discussed is emotions. They can affect the behaviour
                        positively or negatively, meaning that they have a strong effect on the possibility of producing
                        a
                        purchase. Emotional experiences that are positive can lead to a good experience and, therefore,
                        increase the chances for the product to be a success (Kujale & Talya, 2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>The inclusion of a way to represent the stages of the user experience in a continuous cycle is
                        the
                        best way to present a model that will explain the variation of emotions and perceptions over
                        time.</p>

                    <p>Taking into account the above, the ContinUE model proposed by (Pohlmeyer et al.,2009) does take
                        into
                        account the cycles of user experience in a continuous way.</p>
