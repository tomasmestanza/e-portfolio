                    <p>After reading the posts of my fellow students who chose the same use case as I did, we agree that
                        Corazon covered several principles of the ACM Code of Ethics and the BSC. Below is the
                        comparison table.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>One specific point I would disagree with Stella is that Corazon may be diminishing the severity
                        of
                        the device's vulnerabilities. The balance of risk and functionality is precise to each case, and
                        in
                        some cases, the acceptable risk level may differ. If the identified vulnerability can result in
                        a
                        reset of the hard-coded values, exploitation will reset the value and restart the monitoring;
                        the
                        effect does not represent a significant danger to the patient. This is not to say that
                        improvements
                        cannot be made, and the hard-coded value cannot be replaced with a dynamic one if this prevents
                        the
                        monitoring reset.</p>

                    <p>Another aspect mentioned is the differences between legal and ethical enforcement mechanisms. The
                        ethics enforcement mechanisms remain a challenge in itself. The repetitive losses result in
                        insufficient as a consequence of not complying with the ethics principles (Hagendorff, 2020).
                        The
                        consideration by Michael encounters a place here when he mentions the need for a constant
                        evolution
                        of the BCS and ACM Codes to perhaps be the basis for a larger framework that could cover all
                        aspects
                        of ethics.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your
                            purpose?</strong><br>
                        Our research will use a qualitative method as we will be relying on other
                        researchers opinions, collecting data,
                        interviewing, observing, and recording. Our ideas will be the result of other's ideas. Also, we
                        will have an
                        inductive view on theory and research.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</strong><br>
                        As this research will be based on secondary resources, we will use analysis and synthesis of
                        existing data collected from articles, government and organisations reports, and books mainly.


                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</strong>
                        <br>
                        Analysis & Synthesis are the main skills required.

                        Interviews and Survey Design</h3>

                    <p><strong>Interviews:</strong> A common data collection research method. Conversational method.
                        When it is
                        face-to-face, it gives an opportunity to read the body language of the respondent. Allows
                        asking for more questions to obtain in-depth information.

                    <p><strong>Survey design:</strong> Can be online, the information is available to the
                        researcher in real time. Whichever
                        The method used should have a balance between open and closed questions.

                    <p><strong>Pre and post-testing and analysis:</strong> Market research version of the before
                        and after picture seen in weight-loss product commercials. Measuring things before (pre)
                        and after (post) allows us to measure
                        changes. Comparing the quality of specific site content can be a valuable case for
                        applying pre and post-testing and analysis.

                    <p><strong>Analysis: </strong> When the data collected is quantitative, the analysis can be
                        done to compare the performance of the old against the new version. For qualitative
                        data, asking the right questions
                        will be the measure of the quality of the analysis.</p>
