                    <p><strong>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys
                            In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore,
                            2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users.</strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>
                            Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of
                            inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various
                            ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.
                            Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor
                            for formative feedback.</strong></p>




                    <p><strong>What happened? </strong><br>

                        Cambridge researcher Aleksandr Kogan designed an application that featured a personality quiz,
                        and
                        Cambridge Analytica (CA) paid individuals to take it (Rehman, 2024). The results of this
                        quiz were
                        used for the 2016 election campaign of American ex-president Donald Trump, which generated much
                        criticism as it could take advantage of voters with vulnerable profiles.
                          <br><br>
                        The collateral information taken from each account (friends, liked content) affected more than
                        80
                        million profiles. 
                          <br><br>
                        It is claimed that data was collected and used without consent, which represented
                        Facebook's worst
                        known data leak, which originated an investigation from the Federal Trade Commission for
                        supposedly
                        not safeguarding the data security agreements or regulations such as GDPR.
                          <br><br>
                        The data is blamed for being collected without consent. According to (Bareebe, 2022), only
                        270,000
                        users consented to the app using their data, however, the information of 87 million Facebook
                        profiles were accessed by data scientists through their friends' feeds. Facebook on his defence
                        claimed that the participants consented the collection of data. 
                         </p>
                    <p><strong>The issues</strong><br>

                        The lack of explicit consent by the users regarding what part of their information was going to
                        be
                        collected and used presents an ethical and legal problem. 
                          <br><br>
                        As the collected data was used to build psychological profiles, to use it in personalised
                        advertisements for political campaigns means that most 'vulnerable' people could be targeted to
                        receive ads built to convince voters, like in the case of the American 2016 elections (Rehman,
                        2019). 
                          <br><br>
                        CA came into possession of Facebook's private data, which consisted of tens of millions of users
                        (The New York Times, 2018). This must have gotten Facebook's attention on the security measures
                        that
                        were applied to protect their users' privacy. So the problem was not just the way CA obtained
                        data
                        through the quizzes and then used it to build profiles but also the way that Facebook 'allowed'
                        this
                        to happen. 
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Similar case</strong><br>

                        Also, in 2018, another scandal occurred when Statistics Canada (StatCan) encountered a massive
                        problem when collecting sample data of 500,000 people, following this by requesting financial
                        data
                        from bank entities. Several media reports revealed that StatCan requested several banks to
                        provide
                        them with lists of financial transaction information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians
                        (Zimonjic, 2018). 
                          <br><br>
                        In this case, StatCan justified the financial data collection by stating that traditional
                        statistical methods are not sufficient to measure the Canadian economy accurately. Also, StatCan
                        tried to ensure worried participants that their data would be secure by ensuring the highest
                        level
                        of privacy and confidentiality (Zimonjic, 2018). 
                          <br><br>
                        The participants were surprised and worried when they discovered that StatCan was requesting
                        financial information from their banks, which revealed that StatCan failed to communicate
                        effectively with the survey participants. They had to clearly state the type of data they would
                        be
                        collecting, the purpose of it, and the scope of the research.

                        Questionnaire Design</h3>

                    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

                    <p>Decide the information required
                        Define target respondents
                        Choose the method to reach target respondents
                        Decide the content of the questions
                        Develop the question wording
                        Put questions into meaningful order and format
                        Define the length of a questionnaire
                        Pre-test the questionnaire
                        Develop the final survey form</p>

                    <p>Questionnaires are cheap, but the return rate is 10%.</p>

                    <p>We need to be aware of the likelihood of respondents giving false answers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Closed question:</strong> A list of alternatives to choose from. The obtained information
                        can be converted
                        into quantitative data. Likely to obtain false answers that don't express the actual
                        participant's
                        feelings.</p>

                    <p><strong>Open Question:</strong> To obtain more detailed answers. Elaborated qualitative data. It
                        assumes the
                        respondent has better writing skills to express their feelings.</p>

                    <p><strong>Questionnaire design</strong></p>

                    <p>Questions should refer to the aim of the research and be clear and short. Long questionnaires can
                        be
                        easily abandoned. Logically progress from general to specific.  The answer to a question should
                        not
                        affect the answer to another question. The language of the questions should match the language
                        of
                        the responders.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ethical issues</strong></p>

                    <p>The researcher must protect the confidentiality of the respondents.

                    <p><strong>Seven Deadly Survey Questions</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>The first question will influence the way the respondents answer the other questions. It is
                            a
                            good
                            idea to provide an "other' options in the list of answers.</li>
                        <li>Do not assume anything about the respondents. This is in terms of habits, nationality, etc. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Like the leading question, there are others that can seem to push the respondent to answer
                            in a
                            certain way.</li>
                        <li>Avoid double negative and negative questions. Make them as logical as possible.</li>
                        <li>Be prepared for the respondent to pick a random question.</li>
                        <li>Put only one issue in one question to avoid asking for more than one answer.</li>
                        <li>A pilot survey can help avoid ambiguous questions.</li>
                    </ul>
