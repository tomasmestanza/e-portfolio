                <h2>Final reflections on the module (921 words)</h2>

                <div class="skills_holder">
                    <p><strong>What</strong></p>
                    <p>After finalising module 6, where we studied the concepts of network security in-depth, focusing
                        on
                        models and frameworks to conduct penetration tests, this module presented a very important topic
                        going towards the completion of this course, Research Methods.</p>

                    <p>The Research Methods and Professional Practice module provides not just a practical base for
                        research methods but also a critical view of the social, legal, cultural and ethical issues that
                        affect computing professionals (University of Essex, N.D.). This module also includes data
                        collection methods, research design, measurement of variables, and sampling. Heading towards
                        completing this course, following this module's content allowed me to gain knowledge and
                        understanding that will help me complete my final project.</p>

                    <p>Before starting this course, I had several objectives in terms of gaining knowledge strictly
                        linked
                        to my career; among those was the one about research and how to effectively produce results that
                        can
                        be scientifically proved and at the same time comply with codes of ethics while observing
                        societal
                        and legal aspects. In this context, the key questions were: How do I structure the final
                        dissertation? How to achieve results by using valid methodologies? How to conduct the final
                        project
                        by observing ethical, societal, and legal rules.</p>

                    <p><strong>So What?</strong></p>

                    <p>Reviewing the ethical base of research was an excellent way of starting the module. Knowing the
                        considerations we have to take into account in relation to the research participants is key to
                        avoiding harm and protecting their privacy and autonomy. The collaborative discussion focusing
                        on
                        ethics applied to AI research was a perfect way to complete the understanding of the relevant
                        concepts. Among these, the two main ways of reasoning (inductive and deductive) were an exciting
                        journey to the times when I studied logic as a pre-graduated student. Refreshing these concepts
                        was
                        something I really enjoyed.</p>

                    <p>While studying Units 2 and 3, the parts that compose the Research Proposal became more apparent.
                        Something really good about this module is the structure of its units, which provide knowledge
                        to
                        complete the assignments promptly. At this point, I was particularly interested in the
                        literature
                        review topic as it would be required to submit the first assignment for this module. After
                        struggling a bit to choose a title for the literature review, I decided that I wanted to work
                        with
                        the Cloud computing concept as generic and take the security risks as something more specific.
                        Watching the seminars, I realised I still needed to drill down on the concept to find something
                        even
                        more specific.</p>

                    <p>Just before the middle of the module, the concepts and types of data collection allowed me to
                        define
                        and confirm I wanted to do qualitative research. Thinking about work, where we maintain and
                        develop
                        features on a cloud-based system relative to growing as a professional, the idea of studying the
                        implications in terms of security was convincing me more and more. I decided to base the initial
                        literature review on e-learning. This meant I made the title even more specific by introducing
                        e-learning, and at the same time, I could use my current practical knowledge of cloud services.
                    </p>

                    <p>Thinking about the research proposal, having specific information and examples on how to conduct
                        the
                        relevant data collection measured my previous ideas and also the data collection I was
                        performing
                        for the literature review assignment. The second collaborative discussion presented questions
                        about
                        ethics, legal and societal responsibilities; the result of the discussion was a timely call to
                        consider these aspects when writing the research proposal and, more importantly, when doing the
                        actual research.</p>

                    <p>Towards the end of the module, and having received my marks for the literature review assignment,
                        I
                        understood I had to work on reducing the turnitin rating. This rating was 28%, which I know is
                        not
                        ideal, but it was the first time I got this type of result. Learning about the different
                        sections of
                        a dissertation completes the picture for me, and I could then finalise the research proposal, in
                        which I introduced the concept of AI by adding the relatively new cloud model service called
                        Artificial Intelligence as a service (AIaaS). I found not much information about using this
                        service
                        directly with a cloud-based e-learning system, so it could potentially be the topic I will use
                        for
                        my dissertation. </p>

                    <p><strong>Statistics</strong>.

                        Considering the examples and statistics exercises, the module's structure was very convenient. I
                        believe they included the most common 
                        aspects that can be applied to research. Statistical calculations in data analysis use
                        descriptive
                        or inferential statistics; the first covers Central Tendency and Variability, and the second
                        covers
                        Differences between means and Variances ( Khan et al., 2023). I enjoyed working through the
                        examples
                        and the exercises provided and, at the same time, refreshed my knowledge of this topic.</p>


                    <p><strong>Now what?</strong></p>
                    <p> Not remembering much about the scientific method and research as a whole process, this module
                        allowed me to look at the next module (Dissertation) with more confidence. Taking things from
                        the
                        beginning an having a structure to work on our next project is something priceless and provide
                        us a
                        path to follow towards its completion.</p>

                    <p>It feels like this is not the reflections on this module but on the whole course. I have gained a
                        lot of new knowledge and also refreshed the existent existent one. Overall, I feel like I have
                        completed my primary goal which was to become more confident when interacting with new trends at
                        work and also looking at trying to apply for a new role with more responsibilities and more
                        demanding in terms of multidisciplinary knowledge.</p>
