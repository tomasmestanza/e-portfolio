                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a
                            project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having
                            collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the
                            reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems
                            to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz
                            is harmful.
                            <br><br>
                            Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in
                            a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either
                            side of any issue.”</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Question 1</strong><br>
                        Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any
                        more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more
                        different conclusions?
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Answer: </strong> I would personally say that if the analysis is based on correct data
                        and follows known
                        standards, then it would still be ethical, considering that both results are presented and
                        published. I say this because the opposite situation, finding that is good for health and then
                        finding that is not good, should have the same approach.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Question 2</strong><br>
                        Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Answer: </strong>To maintain Integrity and transparency, Abi should ethically present
                        both positive and negative analyses. As long as the methodology used is valid, the results
                        should be presented. As a good practice, negative results should be submitted for publication to
                        prevent publication bias and duplication that could lead to a waste of time and money (The
                        Embassy of Good Science, N.D.).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Question 3</strong><br>
                        Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Answer: </strong>As the author, is it accountable for the conduction of the research but
                        not for the use of the results? All funders, employers, and
                        researchers are accountable for providing the conditions in which individuals and organisations
                        are empowered and enabled to own the research process (UKRIO, 2019).

                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Question 4</strong><br>
                        If Abi does present both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will
                        publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he taken?

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Answer: </strong>If he suspects that the hiring company will only publish the research
                        and results that support their approach, then he should present only the first one (negative).
                        The company may accept starting another research with different parameters that also relate to
                        the initial research.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Societal impact must be considered within research. Providing new knowledge can help reduce
                        misinformation, so from this point of view, Abi has the responsibility to society to reveal his
                        findings by publishing them. Potential physical or psychological harm, discomfort, stress or
                        reputational risk to participants and their associates should be considered by researchers
                        (University of Wolverhampton, N.D.). Also, not reporting something that could be harmful to
                        consumers could be considered as negligence and could present legal implications.

                            Consider the container design data in Data Set F (see the Data Annexe). Notice that the two

                            Con1 and Con 2 indeed measure the same characteristic (the number of items sold), but under
                            two
                            different “conditions” (the two different container designs).<br><br>
                            We conduct a two-tailed related samples t test of whether the underlying (population) mean
                            number of
                            items sold differs between the two container designs</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Data Sets, Observations and Variables</strong>
                        <br>

                        Data sets are organised values of one or more variables of interest (data). These are normally
                        represented by tables of variable names vs individual observations.
                        <br><br>
                        A valid methodology is needed to extract meaningful conclusions from data.
                        <br><br>
                        Ordinal scale: The higher the score, the more attractive the product is to the respondent.<br>
                        Ordinal data is often relative to ranking of a relevant attribute of interest that belong to the
                        product.
                        <br>
                        Nominal: Nominal values can not be ordered. For convenience, it can be re-coded as numeric, but
                        these values don't represent quantities.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>
                            Comparison of Levels of Measurement</strong><br>

                        Data at the higher (ratio and interval) level represent the measurement of quantity
                        (quantitative or metric). Data at the lower (ordinal and nominal) levels are also qualitative or
                        nonmetric.
                        <br><br>
                        Discrete and Continuous Variables<br>
                        Quantitative variables that assume integer variables are called discrete.<br>
                        Variables that can assume all values are called continuous
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Summary measures</strong><br>


                        Two types of measures<br>
                        1. Location. This is the value taken by a typical observation<br>
                        2. Dispersion. Give an idea of how distributed the data is
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Sample Mean and Sample Standard Deviation</strong><br>

                        This is used only for qualitative data. The median and Interquartile range are alternatives to
                        measuring location and dispersion, respectively.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong> Interference</strong><br>


                        Two forms.<br><br>
                        1. using data to estimate underlying population value (Mean)<br>
                        2. Using data to determine whether some assumptions about the underlying population is likely to
                        be true (hypothesis testing)
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Hypothesis testing</strong><br>

                        An alternative form of inference is to use the data to provide evidence about whether some
                        assumption of interest regarding that population value is likely true (hypothesis
                        testing).<br><br>
                        Hypothesis testing is usually preferred to the estimation approach when interest lies in
                        comparing the relevant values underlying two or more different populations.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Definition</strong><br>

                        Hypothesis testing is a method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a parameter in a
                        population using data measured in a sample. It consists of 4 steps.<br><br>

                        1. State the Hypotheses<br>
                        2. Set the Criteria for a Decision (under which criteria the claim tested is true or not)<br>
                        3. Compute the Test Statistic (calculations done on a random sample)<br>
                        4. Make a Decision (compare actual results to what was expected)
