                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Response to Stella</strong></p>

                    <p>I agree with the difficulty of finding a balance between the profits generated by a company and
                        the
                        ethical principles or the perception of its difficulty. It is a delicate subject because the
                        relativity of things and the multiple ways of seeing things require, what you mention, a
                        continuous
                        evaluation to balance the elements.</p>

                    <p>One other part just for this particular case, I may differ from yourself is in the fact that they
                        may be diminishing the severity of vulnerabilities of the device. The balance of risk and
                        functionality may be specific to each case; in some cases, the risks will be considered high,
                        and in
                        others, low. If the identified vulnerability can reset the values, the identification of that
                        event
                        will make the effect depreciable. This is not to say that it cannot be improved.</p>

                    <p>I agree with the perception the public may have regarding the relationship between profit and
                        ethics. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Response to Nisa</strong></p>
                    <p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts.</p>

                    <p>After reading the case study about Corazon, I completely agree with you about the commitment of
                        this start-up to compliance with and observance of codes.</p>

                    <p>I believe the concept of a mechanism to enforce ethics principles is a point on which ethics
                        governance should focus. Legally enforcing ethics principles would mean that the ethics codes
                        would be outside the professionally binding codes. So, a delimitation and definition of what is
                        legal and what is ethical is also needed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Guiding notes</strong></p>

                    <p>What is this, Why is This, How is this (think as a researcher)</p>

                    <p>Independent research -> Act as a researcher to meet the expectations. For example, if the
                        supervisor
                        asks, why are you saying this and not this other? Then, we need to have What, Why and How. Use
                        Methods and Methodology. Research methods are how we obtain data. Methodology is about models
                        and
                        frameworks to conduct your study.</p>

                    <p>There are different research strategies. How are we going actually to do the research? What would
                        be
                        your research strategies? Is it descriptive research? Is it an exploratory type of research? Is
                        it a
                        case study? Is it experimental? Is it developmental? There are almost 10 to 15 different
                        strategies.
                        So you need to come up with it.</p>

                    <p>Project</p>
                    <p>Cloud Computing -> What are the wrong things? What are the challenges and problems? Then,
                        conclude,
                        find a solution (s), and then say the solution to minimise the problem or the impact.</p>

                    <p>Find relevant literature research relative to my topic/concept. How do you nail down this and
                        formulate a research topic? Research design (build new system/ theory / testing an existing
                        system/theory) . Critically evaluate the existing literature for that specific topic.</p>

                    <p>Research is a systematic process aiming to discover new knowledge in a particular field for a
                        particular problem. Interpret and expand that knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Find specific problems in Cloud computer. </p>

                    <p>A single drop of water will be the entry point to start research (describe, explore, experiment,
                        whatever). It must be relative to a particular drop of water. If we don’t know the drop of water
                        we
                        describe it, experiment in order to find out more. Narrow down your thinking/ ideas.</p>

                    <p>Choose a topic you are genuinely interested in finding a solution for that problem.  We can use
                        the
                        same topic for the actual research.</p>


                    <p><strong>Taking into account the above guiding notes, I have picked the title "Security risks in
                            Cloud-based e-learning: A Literature Review" and I have written the following
                            introduction.</strong></p>


                    <p>
                        With early foundations in the 1960s, research in virtualisation, operative systems, storage, and
                        networking in the 1970s and 1980s, the maturity of its foundational technology in the 1990s, the
                        introduction of the modern concepts of cloud computing were materialised by the launching of
                        Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the early 2000s (Varghese, 2019). The modern cloud computing models
                        SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS provide service solutions for different enterprise requirements. As
                        flexibility is one of the main characteristics of cloud computing, the solutions will vary from
                        one organisation to another. The levels of scalability, control, and security are different for
                        different implementations.</p>

                    <p>Storing data on the cloud, where multiple locations potentially exist, represents a security
                        risk. Security risks are associated with some of the fundamental elements of cloud computing,
                        such as virtualisation, limited visibility, and multiple locations. These risks can also include
                        data loss and data breaches.</p>

                    <p>In modern educational systems, mobile, distance and web-based learning are essential and driven
                        by cloud services (Paul et al., 2023). Collaboration is another crucial concept in e-learning;
                        it allows students to interact and work together on tasks assigned by the teachers. Here, the
                        concept of flexibility becomes essential because it makes the mentioned interaction possible.
                        All these benefits can put the security of data at risk, and although cloud service providers
                        invest a lot in security measures, risks are still a problem to solve.</p>

                    <p>In this review, we focus on the security risks that affect the e-learning activities of
                        educational organisations that have moved their services to the cloud, the challenges they face
                        and the actions they take to mitigate or prevent the effects of potential threats.</p>
