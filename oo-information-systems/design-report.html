                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                    <p>As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports the
                        operation of a self-driving car. In your research around the capabilities of self-driving cars,
                        you can search for keywords that include autonomous vehicle, driverless car, robotic car.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are required to identify three operations that you wish to support in your software and
                        provision capability for them through the use of an object-oriented Python program. The system
                        should support the ability for a customer to interact with the system through a front-end.
                    <p>
                        Running in the system back-end should be a capability that simulates the generation and
                        collection of data attributes that represent the wider environment within which the driverless
                        car is operating.</p>


                    <p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        A report including the design of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use case diagram.</li>
                        <li>Activity diagram.</li>
                        <li>Class diagram.</li>
                        <li>Sequence diagram.</li>
                        <li>State Transition Diagram.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The report should also define the capability in your system
                        to retain data within the following data structures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>List.</li>
                        <li>Stack.</li>
                        <li>Queue.</li>
                        <li>Dictionary.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        We have followed the suggested learned UML standard to support the development process of this
                        application. This has included the design of use cases, state, activity, sequence, and class
                        diagrams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of UML made it easy to understand the application's behaviour and structure (Rumbaugh et
                        al., 2005); therefore, the development was driven by the provided standards in Object Oriented
                        approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Object-oriented Programming provided modularity to expand the functions in a simple and
                        organised way. Being the objects independent entities, we are able to work in multiple objects
                        without interfering with other developers.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Use Case Diagram</strong><br>

                    A good attempt with a range of actors and use cases. I think that some of the use cases are slightly
                    too big or too small in terms of their scope but this is not a huge issue. Be careful with the use
                    of include and extend, as an over reliance can make the structure quite 'brittle' with one change
                    having a cascading effect!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Activity Diagram</strong><br>

                    A good example of an activity diagram that demonstrates a good knowledge of UML and a good
                    application of that knowledge. What you have created is appropriate for the scenario and system you
                    have described.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Sequence Diagram</strong><br>

                    Again, these are good examples of sequence diagrams, that demonstrate a good grasp of how the UML
                    should be used. One work of caution, try not to rely too much on returning information to the
                    actor/user in a sequence diagram, we don't care about what we're sending really, just that messages
                    and communication occurs between objects (or themselves).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Class Diagram</strong><br>

                    A nice example of a class diagram that demonstrates a good range of functionality and skills.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>State Diagram</strong><br>

                    There are some bits that need revision and review on state diagrams. Remember you are showing the
                    different states the thing that you are modelling can be in and the transitions to get between them.
                    This means that you should have a label on each edge to illustrate how they transition. Also the
                    diamond decision box is not something you usually use - this is determined by the transitions.
