                    <p>
                        As every Python object includes a reference counter, the data type and the value, the
                        difference between objects is their character of being mutable or immutable. From the three
                        elements mentioned, the value is the only mutable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pointers are references (variables containing an address) to the location of a variable
                        in the memory system. C++ uses pointers, while Python does not. C++ is a compiled language,
                        while Python is an interpreted language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Design Patterns have four elements name, problem, solution, and consequences. Patterns can
                        be of three types, creational, structural and behavioural.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The article tells us that digital technologies have recently been worsening environmental
                        problems. This situation is critical as these digital solutions are meant to reduce these
                        problems. Companies can help by considering the software's carbon footprint in the analysis,
                        design and development and also evaluating the data centres where their software run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Energy consumption by solutions based on trend technologies like AI is increasing exponentially.
                        At this point, companies should consider energy consumption as another parameter during
                        development.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, the article suggests three steps for companies to become more environmentally friendly.
                        Articulate a strategy that guides trade-offs and allows for flexibility, Review and refine the
                        software development life cycle, and Make the cloud green.</p>
                    <p>
                        We can see the importance of a strategy that can cover all elements and actors in the
                        development and use of the software. Companies need to be aware of energy consumption and set
                        limits. This can require lots of training, and considering the changes within IT teams, it can
                        become a complicated task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reviewing and refining the software development life cycle is a process that every company would
                        like to adopt. The cost of using power consumption monitors is not an obstacle to implementing
                        the suggested steps. However, the overall costs can significantly increase depending on the type
                        and size of the software.
                    </p>
                    <p>As mentioned in the article, modern software is nearly always deployed to the cloud, so focusing
                        on this platform is necessary. The exponential growth of cloud services directly affects energy
                        consumption. Adopting hardware that consumes less energy is simple. However, the cost of
                        migrations, especially in companies that still need automated platforms, can again be a big
                        obstacle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the proposed steps to become 'green' are reasonable, but the implementation can face
                        some company resistance.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The concept of Design patterns was interesting to study as it
                        represents a crucial part of the Object-oriented development approach. This becomes even more
                        important because the main aim of developing software is to provide a solution to a problem, and
                        the Design patterns provide ways to reuse a generic solution to solve many types of problems by
                        adapting them to their context, making possible the reusability. With this idea, it was
                        beneficial to study which Design patterns are used most and their associated advantages and
                        issues when applying them.
                    </p>

                        Another interesting fact was to find out that Python is an interpreted language, which means
                        that it executes the code directly. As everything in Python is an object, the absence of proper
                        pointers is something that caught my attention. In the end, we found out that one of the three
                        essential elements of an object, the reference counter, acts as a pointer.
