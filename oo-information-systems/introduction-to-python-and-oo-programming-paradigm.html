                        Object-Oriented Metrics and Its Reusability: A Decade
                        Review
                    </h3>
                    <p>Reusable components have to be provided to produce a quality software product (Padhy et al.,
                        2018). From there, the aim of prioritising the identified assets is to find the ones that can
                        contribute the most to the reusability rather than focusing on what comes first in the Software
                        development life cycle (SDLC). It is essential to mention that these assets are relative to each
                        type of project, so the order of the factors is also relative.</p>

                    <p>With this in mind, I prioritise the provided list in the following way.</p>

                    <p>1. Use in the Data. As this asset is extracted from the whole SDLC, it can significantly impact
                        the processing time and increase the software's quality.</p>
                    <p>2. Knowledge Requirement. The experience and knowledge accumulated from developing other projects
                        can significantly contribute to quality and efficiency. </p>
                    <p>3. Requirement Analysis. Depending on the type of project, this stage can take up to 10% of the
                        time spent developing a piece of software. As the first stage of every software development
                        project, every reusable element will reduce the time of analysing requirements and provide a
                        significant advantage.</p>
                    <p>4. Planning stage. Knowing which planning techniques would work for a specific type of project
                        can reduce the time spent in this stage. Building the team and planning costs can take time.</p>
                    <p>5. Test Cases / Test Design. The reusability of algorithms and modules will depend on the test
                        results. </p>
                    <p>6. Architecture-driven approach. Using the structure of a preexisting project can lead to
                        significant savings in efforts. However, as mentioned before, every project is different, which
                        sometimes makes it very difficult to reuse the whole structure of a previous project.</p>
                    <p> Although all the presented assets are important, the above six are essential. </p>

                    <h3 class="bold-h3">Summary post on the article by Padhy et al. (2018), State-of-the-Art
                        Object-Oriented Metrics and Its Reusability: A Decade
                        Review
                    </h3>
                    <p>After posting my initial thoughts about the ranking presented by Padhy et al. (2018) and reading
                        the feedback provided by fellow students, one thing is almost inevitable: the relative element
                        when deciding which asset should take priority. As mentioned in my first post, in the real
                        world, a team's projects can be very similar, similar or different. So the criteria I took to
                        create my ranking were based on usability, of course, but also on the assets present across the
                        Software development life cycle. Moreover on, how much will these assets affect each stage?</p>

                    <p>Reducing maintenance costs and saving time are essential tasks (Padhy et al., 2018). If this is
                        an important aim, although an asset can be reusable, the question is how reusable it is to
                        justify its use against starting from scratch.</p>


                    <p>An important question asked by a fellow student was why Arquitecture-driven approach had a low
                        rating on my list. Architectural patterns define the structure of the whole project. However,
                        the question was, how many of those architectural patterns were created to support the
                        development of specific features? This condition inevitably takes us back to the relativity of
                        the project.</p>

                        ePortfolio Development to Foster Reflective and Deeper Learning in an Online Graduate Adult
                        Education Program
                    </h3>
                    <p>The main question to resolve in this research was if an e-portfolio could be a workspace for
                        deeper learning. The focus was on students with online degrees.</p>

                    <p>From the answers the authors found during the research, I could imagine answers related to
                        knowledge, personal growth, and working through reflection, meaning that the students learn by
                        reflecting on their own experiences. One thing that was unexpected as an answer was the fact
                        that
                        students believe the use of e-portfolios drove them to a greater self-discovery. This answer is
                        significant, considering that one aspect of self-discovery is establishing our priorities based
                        on
                        our confidence when we do an activity.</p>

                    <p>In my opinion, and as mentioned in the article, collaboration is important. The sense of
                        responsibility to create something in our words while learning through the course increases
                        confidence and provides an engine to keep improving.</p>

                    <p>Reaffirmation about what we are doing is a powerful tool that allows us to continue this journey.

                        In Python, protected attributes (variables) are more a convention than a requirement. It is
                        expected that the programmers will respect the name convention (_) that indicates that
                        protected attributes shouldn't be accessed from outside their class or without using
                        inheritance.
