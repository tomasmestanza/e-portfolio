                        Object-Oriented Metrics and Its Reusability: A Decade
                        Review
                    </h3>
                    <p>After posting my initial thoughts about the ranking presented by Padhy et al. (2018) and reading
                        the feedback provided by fellow students, one thing is almost inevitable: the relative element
                        when deciding which asset should take priority. As mentioned in my first post, in the real
                        world, a team's projects can be very similar, similar or different. So the criteria I took to
                        create my ranking were based on usability, of course, but also on the assets present across the
                        Software development life cycle. Moreover on, how much will these assets affect each stage?</p>

                    <p>Reducing maintenance costs and saving time are essential tasks (Padhy et al., 2018). If this is
                        an important aim, although an asset can be reusable, the question is how reusable it is to
                        justify its use against starting from scratch.</p>


                    <p>An important question asked by a fellow student was why Arquitecture-driven approach had a low
                        rating on my list. Architectural patterns define the structure of the whole project. However,
                        the question was, how many of those architectural patterns were created to support the
                        development of specific features? This condition inevitably takes us back to the relativity of
                        the project.</p>

                        Development Life Cycle.
                    </h3>
                    <p>Defining the software development (SDLC) life cycle as analysis, design, development, testing,
                        and maintenance, I consider the following UML diagrams as beeing the most applicables to
                        different stages of the SDLC.</p>

                    <p>The use case diagrams will be most used in the Analysis and Testing. In the analysis to
                        understand the actions the system's actors are involved in and in testing because it will
                        provide test cases to this stage. </p>

                    <p>The class diagram will be helpful in the design as this provides a static view of the participant
                        classes and their objects. Before the development, it is necessary to know the list of relevant
                        classes and how they relate. It also provides the list of operations performed on the classes.
                    </p>

                    <p>The state diagram shows the states of an object, and therefore is more important to implement it
                        during the design and after the class diagram. It is also essential to find the events that
                        trigger the changes in the state of the system or object due to external actions.</p>

                    <p>Sequence diagrams are used in design and development as they present the messages sent between
                        objects based on time. </p>
