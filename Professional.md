### Current Firm/Role

Associate Vice President / Connected Vehicle Program Manager and National Practice Leader, Cybersecurity

Providing technical expertise ion program management of Federal research and pilot deployments of connected vehicle technology. Lead author of winning grant application which procured $21 million in funding to design, deploy, test and operate a connected vehicle pilot in Tampa, FL. This project comprises equipping 48 signalized intersections, 1000 privately owned vehicles, 10 transit buses and 9 electric street car trollies with dedicated short range communications (DSRC) in the licensed 5.9 GHz spectrum, to enable vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle to everything else (V2X) applications. These applications fall in categories of safety, mobility and environmental. Quick examples are:

*   Safety application: Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL) warning. This application is V2V based and generates a warning alert to equipped motorists when any other equipped vehicle in front of them, going in the same direction and in the same or immediately adjacent lane applies hard braking. This warning appears in the rear view mirror mounted on the windscreen and allows the equipped motorist to avoid the accordion type collisions typically resulting from such hard braking events.
*   Mobility application: Intelligent Signal (I-Sig). This V2I based application broadcasts Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information to vehicles and vehicles broadcast position, heading, velocity and other relevant data to the roadside equipment which interfaces with the traffic signal controller. Collectively this information is used to adjust (extend) green time to facilitate flushing of building congestion. When applied in sync along a corridor, mobility (volume and throughput) is greatly improved. This application also has an environmental benefit of reducing green- house gasses due to less wait time at intersections as it moves vehicles in efficiently formed platoons.

The major elements of the system is the basic safety message (BSM) which comprises data on vehicle position, heading, speed, path history, yaw, steering controls, and sensors for braking, turn indicators, lights, windscreen wipers, etc. There is also a very stringent requirement for trust that the data received is from a trusted source. This is provided by a security credential management system (SCMS) which uses certificates to establish identity, encryption, message signing etc. This also includes the ability to revoke certificate from devices observed to be misbehaving or suspected of being compromised.
