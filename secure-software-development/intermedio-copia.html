                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Part I</strong><br>
                        In this example, you will compile and run a program in C using the Codio workspace provided
                        (Buffer Overflow in C). The program is already provided as bufoverflow.c - a simple program that
                        creates a buffer and then asks you for a name, and prints it back out to the screen.

                    </p>
                    <div class="code-wrapper">
                        <code>

                            #include <stdio.h> <br>
                            int main(int argc, char **argv)<br>
                            {<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char buf[8]; // buffer for eight characters<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("enter name:"); <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gets(buf); // read from stdio (sensitive function!)<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%s\n", buf); // print out data stored in buf<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0; // 0 as return value<br>
                            }

                        </stdio.h></code>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Now compile and run the code. To test it, enter your first name (or at least the first 8
                        characters of it) you should get the output which is just your name repeated back to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Run the code a second time (from the command window this can be achieved by entering
                        ./bufoverflow on the command line). This time, enter a string of 10 or more characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What happens?</strong><br>
                        An error is shown and the execution gets aborted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What does the output message mean?</strong><br>
                        The buffer size (the memory separated or allocated for the elements of the array) is exceeded.
                        The gets function provided by the header (stdio) doesn’t not control the input’s size.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Part II</strong><br>
                        Now carry out a comparison of this code with one in Python (Buffer Overflow in Python).
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-wrapper">
                        <code>

                            buffer=[None]*10<br>
                            for i in range (0,11):<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer[i]=7<br>
                            print(buffer)

                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Run your code using: Python overflow.py (or use the codio rocket icon)<br>
                        <strong>What is the result?.</strong><br>
                        An error occurred when the element number 11 tries to get assigned to the array. The index
                        refers to a position that was not defined for this array.

                    </p>
                    <p>Run pylint on one of your files and evaluate the output.<br>
                        <strong>What is the result?. Does this tell you how to fix the error above?.</strong><br>
                        The size defined (10) gets exceeded and the programs throws and error to prevent the buffer
                        overflow. When defining an array with a fixed size, this errors can happen.

                    </p>

                        Seminar 1 blog post
                    </h3>

                    <p><strong>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write a
                            300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the
                            inside.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>ISO and its 27000 standards define the vocabulary used in information security management
                        systems.
                        This post focuses on five concepts in section 3 (Terms and definitions) and how to manage people
                        to
                        prevent and respond to cyberattacks. The concepts are level of risk, access control,
                        authentication,
                        corrective actions and documented information.</p>

                    <p>The working environment has been expanded, and these days the number of people working remotely
                        has
                        considerably increased. According to Vojinovic (2023), 16% of companies globally are fully
                        remote.
                        This situation inevitably increases the number of connections to corporate networks; with this,
                        the
                        risk of security attacks also increases.</p>

                    <p>In this context, employees must be made aware of the level of risk and the consequences that
                        simple
                        actions like unauthorised downloads on a device connected to the corporate network can cause.
                        The
                        need for a precise security policy results in critical.</p>

                    <p>Regarding access control, the administrators assume responsibility. They define roles and assign
                        permissions to the organisation's resources. This has been the traditional approach to dealing
                        with
                        access control, but with the advent of environments like the Internet of Things (IoT), where
                        complex
                        interactions between users and devices happen, more dynamic control systems are required (Park
                        et
                        al., 2021).</p>

                    <p>Because software inevitably gets outdated, a monitoring system can provide suggestions to improve
                        its security continuously. In a more corporate view, the design of a monitoring system involves
                        employees from different departments. Monitoring security requires technical, organisational and
                        legal measures and actions to analyse and predict the level of safety (Zokirovna, 2018).</p>

                    <p>Corrective actions are the result of vulnerability scans or monitoring system outputs. Verifying
                        the
                        effect of the corrective actions using auditory services is essential and needs to be done in
                        cycles. The cycle approach is vital as the security risk assessment is ongoing.</p>

                    <p>Finally, documenting the information to generate a knowledge base of common issues and generic
                        solutions that can be applied to generic eventual problems. The documented information can
                        include
                        references to the management systems and critical organisational information (ISO/IEC, 2018).

                        Philips, D. (2018) Python 3 Object-Oriented programming, 3rd Ed. Packt Publishing
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Design patterns.</strong><br>

                        We discussed the nature of design patterns when discussing the relevance of the architecture
                        within the parameters that are important for reusability. One of the main concerns to give a
                        high priority was that the design patterns are situation specific. The design patterns are a
                        suggested solution to the problems of OOP (Philips, 2018). According to the author, patterns are
                        a specific set of interactions of objects to resolve a generic problem. The challenge is to
                        recognise what version of the generic problem is the one we are trying to resolve and adopt the
                        generic solution to the specific problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Iterator design patterns</strong><br>
                        In Python, known iterators are built considering pre-existing OOP patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Comprehensions</strong><br>
                        Syntaxes that transform utterable objects into a normal list, set or dictionary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>List comprehensions</strong><br>
                        These map input values to output values and can apply filters to restrict the output.<br><br>

                        The above does not just apply to Lists but also to Sets and Dictionaries.<br><br>

                        More advanced features are included in Python. These features make use of the OOP principles to
                        improve performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Generator expressions</strong><br>

                        Allow the comprehension syntaxes to read one object at a time. This operation saves memory
                        space.<br><br>

                        Generator expressions are also a type of comprehension that compresses the generator's syntax to
                        one line.
