                        Collaborative Discussion 2: Cryptography case study: TrueCrypt
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The (anonymous) TrueCrypt authors have said “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may
                            contain unfixed security issues” (http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/, 2014). Does the
                            cryptanalysis provided above prove or disprove this assumption?<br><br>
                            Would you be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment?
                            What caveats (if any) would you add?</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Question 1.</strong> The (anonymous) TrueCrypt authors have said, "Using TrueCrypt is not
                        secure as it may
                        contain unfixed security issues" (http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/, 2014). Does the
                        cryptanalysis
                        provided above prove or disprove this assumption?</p>

                    <p>From the finding of the Audit Project, some of the main issues are relative to the operative
                        system
                        and its features. Some of the recommendations are updating independent parts of the OS. These
                        recommendations reveal that the environment where TrueCrypt had to run greatly impacted its
                        security
                        performance. Others can argue that TrueCrypt could have adapted to use the OS more efficiently
                        and
                        securely. The difficult maintenance is not directly proportional to its security risk levels.
                        However, it could impact it in the long term as all other activities are made slow with complex
                        maintenance. As indicated in the studio, finding bugs also becomes a difficult task.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the study by Junestam & Guigo (2014) concludes with the absence of high-level severity
                        vulnerabilities and, at the same time, shows that most vulnerabilities found are informational
                        and
                        low. These findings leave the definition of acceptable risks as the key to whether to adopt the
                        solution. Models, metrics and methodologies are necessary to understand when the risks are
                        acceptable, and analysis is needed to mitigate too high risks (Asnar & Zannone, 2008).</p>

                    <p>It is clear that TrueCrypt is not 100% secure, but in many cases, acceptable levels of security
                        risks will determine if the solution is suitable or not. So it does not prove the assumption.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Question 2.</strong> Would you be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure
                        storage
                        environment? What caveats (if any) would you add?</p>

                    <p>Currently not. However, placing ourselves in the context of time and considering the definition
                        of
                        acceptable risk levels, and the availability of other solutions around that time, we would have
                        recommended the solution with the following caveats.</p>

                    <p>If recoverability is critical and searchability very important, then another solution could meet
                        the
                        requirements in a better way.</p>

                    <p>The weak header volume key derivation described in the studio is the main cryptographic concern.
                        The
                        mounted volume's physical security will need to be a priority.</p>

                    <p> <br><br>Answer the following questions:<br><br>

                        <strong>Why did you select the algorithm you chose?<br>
                        </strong>
                        I would prefer the RSA algorithm as it is secure and widely used. As an asymmetric algorithm, It
                        uses a public encryption key and a digital signature to ensure that only the intended receiver
                        can access the original information (Milanov, 2009).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
                        GDPR requires companies to use techniques to ensure the secure process, store and transfer
                        of
                        personal data, and when this is not implemented, regulatory investigations may be initiated.
                        (ICO, N.D.). RSA is used in SSL certificates, and it is proved that guarantees the legitimate
                        own of the
                        private key. This algorithm has become standard for communication over the internet as it
                        protects data during its transmission.
