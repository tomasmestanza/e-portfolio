                    <p>
                        <strong>Post comment</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>Over the years, It has been proved that Linux is a very portable operative System capable of
                        running
                        on different hardware architectures. There is an important reference to portability in the
                        discussion and this makes relevant the following statement. The Linux approach to portability
                        includes architecture-independent interfaces and core code, presenting portable features that do
                        not
                        need much optimisation work (Love, 2010). Linux is also used a lot in cloud environments these
                        days,
                        allowing the implementation of microservices infrastructure to host software composed of
                        independent
                        services.</p>

                    <p>The fact that many organisations are adopting microservices architecture at the infrastructure
                        and
                        application level because of the ability to provide independent scalability and independent
                        deployments does not prove that Linux is still a monolithic OS that will not be used in the
                        future
                        and is destinated to disappear as a monolithic OS solution.</p>

                    <p>As Linux distributions continue being a fast solution even running on these days cloud
                        infrastructure, I disagree with the above statement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Blockchain Security</strong></p>

                    <p>Blockchain security encloses encryption, distributed network and consensus to produce the
                        structure
                        of data with inherent security elements (IBM, N.D.).</p>

                    <p>It can maintain track of transactions by using interconnected blocks that represent a public key
                        containing a history of transactions. The consensus concept refers to a security algorithm.
                        To validate transactions according to the agreement of most nodes in the distributed network. To
                        base the trust on this consensus means that there is no centralised trust authority.</p>

                    <p>An example of a blockchain platform is Bitcoin (cryptocurrency).</p>

                    <p>These platforms are not exempt from cyber attacks, as the number of incidents of this type can
                        prove
                        it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</strong></p>

                    <p>They are hybrid, meaning an intersection between both the cybernetic and physical world exists.
                        These systems are also heterogeneous because they enclose different types of components. These
                        opponents are distributed, meaning that they are separated physically and temporally.</p>

                    <p>CPSs are also Large-Scale systems, and their environment is dynamic. Dynamism enforces
                        adaptability.</p>

                    <p>CPSs finally include the human factor, which is materialised with the interaction between devices
                        and people.</p>

                    <p>An example of this type of system is Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</p>
