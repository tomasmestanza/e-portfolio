                    <p>
                        Hi Francis, </p>
                    <p>Thank you for your post.</p>

                    <p>As I agree with your considerations about TrueCrypt levels of security, considering that a
                        vulnerability does not translate into risk without a threat, what levels of security would be
                        considered secure enough to decide the implementation of a software solution? In our view, it
                        will all depend on the definition of acceptable risk levels, which, as mentioned by Asnar &
                        Zannone (2008), are based on models, metrics, and methodologies that are necessary to understand
                        when the risks are acceptable.</p>

                    <p>Also, as it is well known, flows implementing security need to be applied to each SDLC phase,
                        and methods need to be used to decrease the complexity of the security issues so developers can
                        implement them in a simpler way (Pourzandi, 2005). In the case of TrueCrypt, the medium issues
                        with the kernel made me conclude that there were problems during the environment analysis. I
                        would like to know your opinion about it or if you consider the main issues happened in a
                        different phase of the SDLC?</p>

                    <p>Hi Bradley,</p>

                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to respond to my post.</p>

                    <p>The relationship descriptions, as you mentioned, can be improved, and they will be improved in
                        the summary post. Although I have not found a strict way or format to describe the
                        relationships, it appears that this will depend on what type of relationship is needed to be
                        described. For example, some describers have one word, others three words, etc. In the ontology
                        I propose, 'is' should be described better to make the relationships clearer to the reader.</p>

                    <p>To show the concepts used in the TrueCrypt study, Cryptography is a subclass of Vulnerability.
                        The same applies to its siblings.</p>

                        Read the Cryptography with Python blog at tutorialspoint.com (link is in the reading list).
                        Select one of the methods described/ examples given and create a python program that can take a
                        short piece of text and encrypt it.<br><br>

                        <br>Create a python program in Codio (you can use the Jupyter Notebooks space provided in the
                        Codio
                        resources section) that can take a text file and output an encrypted version as a file in your
                        folder on the Codio system. Demonstrate your program operation in this weekâ€™s seminar

                    <p> <br><br>Answer the following questions:<br>

                        <strong>Why did you select the algorithm you chose?<br>
                        </strong>
                        I would prefer the RSA algorithm as it is secure and widely used. As an asymmetric algorithm, It
                        uses a public encryption key and a digital signature to ensure that only the intended receiver
                        can access the original information (Milanov, 2009).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
                        GDPR requires companies to use techniques to ensure the secure process, store and transfer
                        of
                        personal data, and when this is not implemented, regulatory investigations may be initiated.
                        (ICO, N.D.). RSA is used in SSL certificates, and it is proved that guarantees the legitimate
                        own of the
                        private key. This algorithm has become standard for communication over the internet as it
                        protects data during its transmission.
