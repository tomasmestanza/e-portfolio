                        Collaborative Discussion 2: Cryptography case study: TrueCrypt
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Summary post</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my initial post, I pointed to the importance of context/time when analysing a solution.
                        Placing the TrueCrypt in the right context is key to understanding its advantages and
                        disadvantages
                        and why it was or was not an acceptable encryption solution.
                    </p>

                    <p>I would like to insist on the fact that the study by Junestam & Guigo (2014) found no
                        vulnerability categorised as critical, and
                        therefore looking at other available solutions was very important to choose or not TrueCrypt as
                        a solution. </p>

                    <p>One thing was clear, and it was that TrueCrypt could not be used these days, and its use should
                        not be
                        recommended. In my view, the use of such an old solution and not a more intelligent approach
                        available these days can not be justified.</p>

                    <p>In terms of the proposed ontology to represent the concept in the study conclusions and after
                        receiving feedback from a fellow student, I decided to add more descriptive relationships
                        labels. As mentioned in my reply, I was not able to find a strict way or format to describe
                        the
                        relationships, and it appears that this will depend on what type of relationship is needed to be
                        described</p>

                    <p>With this consideration in mind, I updated my proposed ontology, to describe in a better way the
                        relationships between the included concepts. This is shown in the below image.</p>

                        Faceted Data
                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Read Schmitz et al (2016) article about faceted data.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Question 1</strong><br>

                        Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and
                        cons?

                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Answer</strong><br><br>The solution proposed in the article offers a solution to maintain
                        the secure flow of information
                        within a system. Applications without such control are more likely to leak sensitive
                        information.</p>

                    <p>Using Haskell language, defined by (Haskell, N.D.) as an advanced purely functional language that
                        allows the production of robust and correct software systems, the solution is based on faceted
                        values and imperative programming through monads.</p>

                    <p>Although the solution appears to be complex, assessing the cost/benefit is critical to adopt such
                        a
                        solution. If the workflow within a system is not secure, the information is in a constant state
                        of
                        vulnerability.</p>



                    <p><strong>Question 2</strong><br>
                        Create a basic outline design of how you would create such a system in Python.
                    </p>


                    <p><strong>Answer</strong><br><br>
                    <ul class="list">

                        <li>1. Identify the risks and the levels of acceptability.</li>
                        <li>2. Design an architecture that allows the implementation of security in every stage of the
                            SDLC.</li>
                        <li>3. Write the code taking into account the security outlined in the design.</li>
                        <li>4. Apply security tests and test the deployment.</li>
                        <li>5. Apply necessary patches as a measure of security maintenance.</li>

                    </ul>
