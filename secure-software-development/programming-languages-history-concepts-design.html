                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Part I</strong><br>
                        In this example, you will compile and run a program in C using the Codio workspace provided
                        (Buffer Overflow in C). The program is already provided as bufoverflow.c - a simple program that
                        creates a buffer and then asks you for a name, and prints it back out to the screen.

                    </p>
                    <div class="code-wrapper">
                        <code>

                            #include <stdio.h> <br>
                            int main(int argc, char **argv)<br>
                            {<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char buf[8]; // buffer for eight characters<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("enter name:"); <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gets(buf); // read from stdio (sensitive function!)<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%s\n", buf); // print out data stored in buf<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0; // 0 as return value<br>
                            }

                        </stdio.h></code>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Now compile and run the code. To test it, enter your first name (or at least the first 8
                        characters of it) you should get the output which is just your name repeated back to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Run the code a second time (from the command window this can be achieved by entering
                        ./bufoverflow on the command line). This time, enter a string of 10 or more characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What happens?</strong><br>
                        An error is shown and the execution gets aborted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What does the output message mean?</strong><br>
                        The buffer size (the memory separated or allocated for the elements of the array) is exceeded.
                        The gets function provided by the header (stdio) doesn’t not control the input’s size.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Part II</strong><br>
                        Now carry out a comparison of this code with one in Python (Buffer Overflow in Python).
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-wrapper">
                        <code>

                            buffer=[None]*10<br>
                            for i in range (0,11):<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer[i]=7<br>
                            print(buffer)

                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Run your code using: Python overflow.py (or use the codio rocket icon)<br>
                        <strong>What is the result?.</strong><br>
                        An error occurred when the element number 11 tries to get assigned to the array. The index
                        refers to a position that was not defined for this array.

                    </p>
                    <p>Run pylint on one of your files and evaluate the output.<br>
                        <strong>What is the result?. Does this tell you how to fix the error above?.</strong><br>
                        The size defined (10) gets exceeded and the programs throws and error to prevent the buffer
                        overflow. When defining an array with a fixed size, this errors can happen.

                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>
                            You should read Chapter 2,6,7,8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman
                            (2019)
                            and then answer the questions below, adding them as evidence to your e-portfolio.</strong>

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        A secure language should provide the following characteristics.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow implementation of Confidentiality, integrity and availability</li>
                        <li>Strong security protection</li>
                        <li>Resilience</li>
                        <li>Abstraction and provided buffer error.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>2. Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        While we can notice security issues with different versions of Python, like serialising objects
                        or
                        overflow errors, making software secure is a practice more than a concept of characteristic.
                        However, the language used for development has to provide the tools to implement security
                        concepts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to its popularity, Python is also vulnerable in terms of libraries that can create security
                        holes, and third-party components can bring vulnerabilities If these are compromised with
                        security
                        breaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the point of view of containing the necessary tools to prevent security issues, I consider
                        Python a secure language. Security is an ongoing task, and a big percentage depends on the
                        implementation.

                    </h3>

                    <p>My initial thoughts about the deserialisation of untrusted data, outlined by OWASP (N.D.),
                        included
                        the security risks of consuming serialised objects without prior validation.</p>

                    <p>After further research and considering an important suggestion by a fellow student, I agree that
                        a
                        more structured process has to be applied to avoid the consumption of untrusted serialised data.
                        Security measures during serialisation, transmission and deserialisation are essential to
                        mitigate
                        the potential effects of this vulnerability.</p>

                    <p>The first of these three processes (serialisation) can only be applied if the data to be consumed
                        is, in a way, part of the same system. Being able to participate in the serialisation process
                        will
                        allow the use of less complex data formats and avoid the serialisation of sensitive data (Trad,
                        2022).</p>

                    <p>On the transmission of the data, TLS/SSL certificates and a digital signature are advised to
                        evaluate the data integrity (Trad, 2022).</p>

                    <p>Once the data arrives at the requester, validation and sanitation should be performed along with
                        other security measures. At this point, having an updated list of measures is critical. These
                        security measures have to be tested periodically.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the flow diagram, the feedback received was about including an activity diagram to show
                        a
                        legitimate and a malevolent actor more precisely. The diagram is below.</p>

                    <p>
                        <center><img src="../images/module3/deserialisation-activity.png" /></center>
                    </p>

                    <p>The diagram shows the importance of having an up-to-date set of security measures when
                        deserialising
                        the data.</p>
