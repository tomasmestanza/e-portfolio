                    <p><strong>What limits the number of iterations? What is the implication for application and system
                            security?</strong>

                    <p>
                        By default, the maximum depth for recursion in Python is 1000. This can be overwritten using the
                        function setrecursionlimit that belongs to the sys library (W3docs, N.D.).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A recursive solution can be slower than an iterative one and consume more memory (Rubio-Sanchez,
                        2018). Applications using recursive algorithms could encounter memory overflow problems when the
                        number of calls performing a large number of calls

                    <p><strong>1. What is ReDOS, and what part does ‘Evil Regex’ play?</strong><br>
                        ReDOS is a denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of poor implementation of regular
                        expressions to make a program enter into a state where they perform very slowly (Weidman, N.D.).
                        Evaluating an input that takes a long time to process means that finding matches for the regular
                        expression also takes a long time. This situation happens because the complexity of the pattern,
                        in
                        the worse case, can be exponential. This is called the ‘Evil Regex’, and it can be exploded by
                        attackers to make systems hang for a long time.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be
                            mitigated?</strong><br>

                        Regular expression patterns can be susceptible of injections attacks, web attacks, etc (Weidman,
                        N.D.). Avoiding ‘Evil Regex’ can help to prevent attacks but this has proven to be a difficult
                        task.
                        Identifying and rewriting the regular expression patterns that are potentially vulnerable to
                        attacks
                        is a critical action to avoid ReDOS.<br><br>

                        In terms of mitigating the effects of a ReDOS attack, this is the only option when the
                        application
                        uses a backtracking engine. When this is the situation, in this situation, the regex engine will
                        need to abort the operation when a suspicious attempt for a match happens , rather than
                        continuing
                        until the script crashes or gets killed by the operative system
                        (https://www.regular-expressions.info/redos.html).<br><br>


                        <strong>3. How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?</strong><br>

                        Well formed regular expression patterns contribute to security by being part of firewall rules,
                        detecting malware or validating user inputs. They can also be used in analytical tools that
                        validate
                        the security of software (Abahussain & Hammad, 2019)

                    </h3>

                    <p>My initial thoughts about the deserialisation of untrusted data, outlined by OWASP (N.D.),
                        included
                        the security risks of consuming serialised objects without prior validation.</p>

                    <p>After further research and considering an important suggestion by a fellow student, I agree that
                        a
                        more structured process has to be applied to avoid the consumption of untrusted serialised data.
                        Security measures during serialisation, transmission and deserialisation are essential to
                        mitigate
                        the potential effects of this vulnerability.</p>

                    <p>The first of these three processes (serialisation) can only be applied if the data to be consumed
                        is, in a way, part of the same system. Being able to participate in the serialisation process
                        will
                        allow the use of less complex data formats and avoid the serialisation of sensitive data (Trad,
                        2022).</p>

                    <p>On the transmission of the data, TLS/SSL certificates and a digital signature are advised to
                        evaluate the data integrity (Trad, 2022).</p>

                    <p>Once the data arrives at the requester, validation and sanitation should be performed along with
                        other security measures. At this point, having an updated list of measures is critical. These
                        security measures have to be tested periodically.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the flow diagram, the feedback received was about including an activity diagram to show
                        a
                        legitimate and a malevolent actor more precisely. The diagram is below.</p>

                    </p>

                    <p>The diagram shows the importance of having an up-to-date set of security measures when
                        deserialising
                        the data.</p>
