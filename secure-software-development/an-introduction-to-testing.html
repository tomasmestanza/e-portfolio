                    <p><strong>Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexityâ€™s Relevance Today</strong><br><br>

                        The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code
                        design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today?
                        Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure
                        software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with
                        your team.

                    </p>

                    <p>In general, cyclomatic complexity is associated with supporting testing processes and helping
                        reduce code complexity. In testing, the more execution paths are counted, the more test case
                        can
                        be written to cover all possible variations in the code execution (Schults, 2021).</p>

                    <p>As a metric, cyclomatic complexity can be used to help project managers and software
                        development
                        teams to assess software and can be determined automatically from source code (Ikerionwu,
                        2010).</p>

                    <p>One main criticism of cyclomatic complexity indicates that the technique does not distinguish
                        between selection statements with and without an ELSE clause. However, this issue is only
                        significant when the metric is meant to capture the complexity of comprehension (). However,
                        it
                        is well known that code comprehension can be measured using other metrics, such as cognitive
                        complexity.</p>

                    <p>Cyclomatic complexity is also part of several testing frameworks contributing to software
                        security. A study by NASA (2020) concludes that low cyclomatic complexity values mean that
                        code
                        verification and testing will be simplified and that cyclomatic complexity should be applied
                        to
                        safety and mission-critical functions.</p>

                    <p>Cyclomatic complexity remains useful because of its applicability in testing. It can help to
                        determine the number of test cases that are fundamental to finding the system's features
                        that
                        are not performing as specified. The technique provides a useful quantitative measure of the
                        logical complexity of software (Ikerionwu, 2010).</p>
