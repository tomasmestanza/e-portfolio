                <div class="skills_holder">
                    <p>1090 words</p>
                    <h3 class="bold-h3"><strong>What</strong></h3>

                    <p>After finalising module 2, where we studied the concepts of reusability in-depth, UML models, and
                        Object-oriented programming with Python, This module presented a very important topic in
                        Computer
                        Science, Security.</p>

                    <p>The Secure Software Development module reviews traditional and more contemporary Software
                        Development Life Cycles (SDLC), especially in the areas where security measures are applied.
                        This
                        module also includes secure languages, design and modern development models (University of
                        Essex,
                        N.D.). Continuing with my aim of refreshing my knowledge and getting up to date with new trends
                        in
                        IT, following this module's content allowed me to gain new knowledge and structure the existing
                        one.</p>

                    <p>At work, we always discuss Security as an ongoing task that must be implemented and tested
                        continuously. However, how much of that were we doing correctly and using the current trends?
                        What
                        are the most used techniques, when, and to what type of projects to apply? These were some of
                        the
                        critical questions I had at the beginning of this Module 3.</p>

                    <h3 class="bold-h3 "><strong>So What?</strong></h3>

                    <p><strong>Module content & tools</strong></p>

                    <p>Reviewing the OWASP Vulnerability document was an excellent way of starting the module. Knowing
                        the
                        security concerns made understanding the concepts we reviewed throughout the module easier. The
                        standard awareness document was used during the design of the Health Monitoring system my team
                        chose
                        as a code assignment and helped us to implement security measures.</p>

                    <p>The programming language concepts we studied were well-known, as I used them often at work. REGEX
                        and Recursion. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of implementing these solutions is
                        essential
                        not just regarding Security but also in terms of performance.</p>

                    <p>Using tools for testing speeded up the syntax testing process and expanded the use of Pylint in
                        the
                        previous module by adding Pylama and Flake8 as tool options for testing. The difficulty here was
                        that these tools reported different error formats. So, I had to decide to focus on Pylama to
                        audit
                        and analyse the code I was writing. This is not to say that the tools can not be used together.
                    </p>

                    <p>Just after the middle of the module, the concepts of Faceted and Data Monads were new to me and
                        represented an excellent challenge to research more about them. Haskell language opened a new
                        window
                        of thinking when I realised there was much more to learn in my programming skills. Again, it was
                        a
                        nice challenge which I will go more in-depth soon.</p>

                    <p>Towards the end of the module, the discussion about cryptography and operative systems resulted
                        in a
                        very beneficial understanding of the criterion to consider when opting for an encryption
                        solution.
                        Developing APIs for distributed environments was also an exciting Unit, as I have worked
                        developing
                        RESTFUL APIs in PHP for several years. Running the APIs on a small local server was something I
                        did
                        for the very first time with Python.</p>

                    <p>The Microservices and Microkernels debate in Unit 11 presented a question about monolithic and
                        microkernel-based operative systems. From my experience and knowledge, being Linux a very
                        portable
                        OS (Love, 2010) and being used in modern cloud infrastructure these days, it was clear that the
                        statement "Torvalds has been proven wrong, and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices
                        and
                        microkernels are the future" was not correct, in my opinion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Programming</strong></p>

                    <p>The module's structure was very convenient, considering the technique of applying security
                        measures
                        to every stage of the SDLC. Flows implementing Security need to be applied to each SDLC phase,
                        and methods need to be used to decrease the complexity of the security issues so developers can
                        implement them more simply (Pourzandi, 2005). Being Security, the core of the module, it was
                        essential to feel that my expectations would be met at the end of it.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Working in a team</strong></p>


                    <p>Since this was the first time in the course that we would work in teams, several questions came
                        to
                        my mind regarding how we would manage a team with different backgrounds, experiences and skills.
                        After the first meeting, I was pleased all team members were really committed to doing a good
                        job
                        and were always present for the online meetings. We held meetings every Sunday for the first
                        part of
                        the project, and for the second part, we also met on Wednesdays, being these meetings a bit
                        shorter
                        in duration. We also had one-to-one meetings to help each other in case the task assigned was
                        becoming too difficult to complete by the assignee.</p>

                    <p>We could have done more in quickly identifying the project scope rather than enthusiastically
                        losing
                        time suggesting additions to the project that were unrealistic due to the allowed time to
                        complete
                        the project. Another difficult decision was that involving everyone in all activities was
                        beneficial
                        for learning purposes, but this slightly dropped productivity. We all had different backgrounds
                        and
                        skills, so sticking to what we could do better was a final good decision.</p>

                    <p>Using project management tools like Trello, collaboration with Slack and sharing coding tasks,
                        and
                        integration with Github resulted in a productive way of working. The design workflow was
                        implemented
                        on Trello, and it was easy to keep the team members aware of what the others were doing.</p>

                    <p>As part of the tasks for the first part of the assignment, and apart from the research tasks all
                        team members did, I produced the Use Case diagram for the Astronaut Health Monitoring System. I
                        used
                        the knowledge gained in the previous module to produce a solid design model with good feedback
                        from
                        the tutor (Considering that only one suggestion was made and was on the definition of a
                        relationship). For the second part, I was in charge of designing the database architecture,
                        where I
                        used previous knowledge to define a well-normalised database to support the development of the
                        application. We reviewed what we did in every meeting and reported on Wednesdays using a
                        scrum-style
                        meeting.</p>




                    <h3 class="bold-h3 "><strong>Now what?</strong></h3>

                    <p>Not considering myself a Python developer (not yet), this module allowed me to implement what I
                        learned in the previous module regarding Object Oriented Programming. The addition of having to
                        structure a more significant project was also interesting, and after completing this challenge,
                        I
                        felt more confident working within a team on larger Python projects. This confidence will be
                        beneficial when starting projects at work.</p>

                    <p>The integration of Security in all stages of the SDLC is something that I will be using at work.
                        The
                        learned concepts of assessing risks and establishing acceptable levels of these risks are
                        essential
                        to implement Security throughout the SDLC. I will research this topic as it is vital for
                        designing a
                        strategy.</p>
