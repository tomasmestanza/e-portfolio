                    </h3>


                    <p>Thank you for your post.</p>

                    <p>I think we all agree that emerging technologies bring benefits but also security threats and can
                        make businesses more vulnerable. This is important for organisations that want to start or are
                        in
                        the process of completing their digital transformation.</p>

                    <p>An important challenge for bricks and mortar SMEs is the still lack of security data standards.
                        This
                        situation is tied to the legal aspect of digital transformation, which is also considered a
                        restriction for these enterprises. However, this is also linked to the restriction SMEs can face
                        when integrating into value-added networks if these don’t follow a clear standard, meaning that
                        their scope for value creation can also be restricted (Singh, 2023).</p>

                    <p>I wanted to point to this restriction as I consider it critical for SMEs and their digital
                        transformation process.</p>

                    </h3>

                    <p><strong>Using the website(s) assigned to you in Unit 1, carry out the following exercise and
                            answer the
                            questions listed below.
                            <br><br>

                            Carry out a literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities
                            database
                            to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with websites.</strong>
                    </p>



                    <p>It is very important to identify common vulnerabilities. By searching the national
                        vulnerabilities
                        database (NVD), we found vulnerabilities specifically identified in the Softaculous and
                        Coppermine
                        galleries. These were taken as the base of the potential vulnerabilities in part one of the
                        module
                        assignment.</p>

                    <p>Another source of reported vulnerabilities we used is
                        https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.
                        We checked vulnerabilities there but found nearly the same as NVD. Later, I noticed that this
                        website uses the NVD API as a source.</p>


                    <p>The article (Odeh & Hijazi, 2023) was important because it it showed not just common
                        vulnerabilities
                        but also ways to detect and prevent them, establishing this way a path to follow in the second
                        part
                        of the assignment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Questions</strong><br><br>

                        <strong>Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites
                            and the
                            national vulnerabilities database?</strong><br>

                        We found no issues compared to previous research because it matched the sources indicated in the
                        requirements for this activity.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How did you overcome them?</strong><br>

                        The lists of vulnerabilities are well known, but applying them to the assigned website presents
                        the
                        restriction of not having access to the customised code. Analysing the framework boilerplate is
                        possible as it is open source, but this won’t cover the specific vulnerabilities introduced by
                        customisation.
                        <br><br>
                        Introducing another type of literature helped to fill the gaps in the databases or lists.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How will they affect your final report?</strong><br>

                        As the baseline is based on known vulnerabilities, the final report list of vulnerabilities will
                        be
                        checked against the list created in the first part of the assignment.

                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>Case notes</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        A routine software update that was infected and used by the malicious code as a means to attack
                        others. Once it gets run by the victims, hackers can communicate with their computers. A
                        connection to the Internet was essential for the attack to succeed. Through the network,
                        hundreds of companies and federal services were affected. Hackers also got to the security and
                        cybersecurity agency. Orion is a network monitoring software, and an update was made to it.
                        Attackers roamed around American computer networks for nine months, and the potential of
                        large-scale damage was the main nightmare for authorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, other less obvious targets now might need more protection.

                        Hackers modified sealed software code, created a system that used domain names to select targets
                        and mimicked the Orion software communication protocols so they could hide in plain sight. And
                        then, they did what any good operative would do: They cleaned the crime scene so thoroughly
                        investigators can't prove definitively who was behind it. The White House has said unequivocally
                        that Russian intelligence was behind the hack. Russia, for its part, has denied any involvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It started with a little piece of code modified that returned a Boolean, this was a test to se
                        if the sealed code could e modified. So in my view, a cracking process run before anything. In
                        the second implant of code, they added a snipped to tell them when developers build something
                        (new feature), this was after checking in the new code by solarwinds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During compilation, Hackers created a temporary update file containing the malicious code. So
                        this malicious code told the system to swap the malicious temp file instead of the solar winds
                        one. So switching fees happened last second before executable was created, this to avoid being
                        spotter by the solar winds audit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The malicious version of the software included code that would give the hackers unfettered,
                        undetected access to any Orion user who downloaded and deployed the update and was connected to
                        the Internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hackers targeted gov entities and they mimicked the way Orion communicated with servers so they
                        couldn't be identified. So once the target was identified they could come active and manipulate
                        files, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early signs were not reported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A second warning came after three months. A Palo Alto cybersecurity company worked with Solar
                        Winds for three months but found nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FireEye company discover finally the intrusion, this was because they had an intrusion too.
                        After,
                        they will discover that it was not just and intrusion but someone stealing lots of testing tools
                        from them.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Evidence that this couldn't just have happened to any software company, Solarwinds marketing
                        site had a list of clients, including gov agencies that used their Orion product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This case also reminds us about password strength and multifactor authentication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hackers used sophisticated methods.
