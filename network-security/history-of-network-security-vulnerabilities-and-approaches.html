                        of the digital economy?
                    </h3>


                    <p>The sophistication of the threats and the availability of data stored on cloud systems require
                        more
                        advanced security strategies to prevent and mitigate the consequences of cyberattacks. We talk
                        about
                        strategies because the security measures should not be individual actions but measures that
                        align
                        with the organisation's business strategy and bring on board all employees.</p>

                    <p>The article (Spremic & Simunic, 2018) explains that while trying to digitalise their activities,
                        companies use digital technologies such as Cloud Services, IoT, etc, and they are now likely to
                        face
                        more complex security incidents. These incidents could affect the competitive position of the
                        organisation.</p>

                    <p>A fully digitalised enterprise is one that has completed the process of digital transformation,
                        which means that digitalisation covers all aspects of its operations, including the automation
                        of
                        its business processes and the integration of digital tools and technology to enhance quality
                        and
                        speed.</p>

                    <p>Potential data exposure in services that use emerging technologies (Cloud services) increases the
                        risks of cyberattacks for digitalised enterprises. The cost of cybersecurity breaches is usually
                        underestimated; it is not only the direct damage to the industry but also the higher costs of
                        insurance (Saeed et al., 2023).</p>

                    <p>Traditional SMEs that offer products and services on a face-to-face basis experience several
                        challenges on their way to becoming digitalised. The absence of infrastructure is one of the
                        main
                        ones, as is the lack of knowledge and skills within the organisation that can be expressed in a
                        lack
                        of mindset. Uncertainty about the advantages, availability and successful integration of digital
                        technologies are also challenges for SMEs (Telukdarie et al., 2022).</p>

                    <p>The article under discussion also mentions that to manage cyber security, organisations must
                        design
                        and implement ways to prevent common attacks, but they must also utilise advanced controls to
                        identify, prevent, and mitigate the risks associated with more sophisticated threats. This is
                        also
                        applicable to the energy and utilities industry, which is also suffering changes due to emerging
                        technologies and consumer expectations. These emerging technologies mean an opportunity for
                        growth
                        but also represent a potential exposure to cyberattacks. From this point of view, I agree with
                        the
                        views expressed in the articles in regard to the 2022 'energy crisis' and also in regards to the
                        importance of an adequate strategy to face potential cyberattacks.</p>

                    <p>The IEEE defines Quality as the group of characteristics of a product or service that
                        represents
                        its ability to satisfy a specific need. </p>

                    <p>A quantitative measure of an attribute that affects software quality is called a quality metric.
                    </p>

                    <p>The achievement of levels of quality is the responsibility of the project manager.</p>

                    <p>The additional work that has to be done due to taking a shortcut solution is called technical
                        debt.</p>

                    <p>Time cost and quality are the constraints to take into account (triple constraints)</p>

                    <p><strong>PMI</strong></p>

                    <p>A situation of a quality output that avoids the technical debt within the triple constraints
                        needs
                        monitoring to achieve quality metrics that can allow the application of corrective actions if
                        needed.</p>

                    <p>As quality is relative, the attributes and ways to measure the quality have to be previously
                        agreed
                        upon with the client to apply tests that can indicate that the quality has been achieved.</p>

                    <p>According to PMI, quality management has three perspectives: quality planning, quality assurance,
                        and quality control.</p>

                    <p>Quality planning. During the quality planning stage, identify the appropriate quality metrics.
                    </p>

                    <p>Quality assurance. Monitor all processes, methods and activities and ensure they comply with the
                        defined standards.</p>

                    <p>Quality control. Activities to evaluate if the product meets the quality requirements. Validate
                        the deliverables and satisfy the stakeholder's quality requirements.</p>


                    <p><strong>ISO/IEC 25010</strong></p>

                    <p>This standard includes six characteristics of quality (recommendation 9126): functionality,
                        reliability, effectiveness, usability, maintainability and portability.</p>

                    <p>In recommendation 25010, ISO / IEC includes eight characteristics of quality. Functional
                        Suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security,
                        maintainability and portability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Quality Management Models</strong></p>

                    <p>The quality management model by McAll (1977) includes eleven characteristics. Integrity,
                        reliability, usability, accuracy, efficiency, maintainability, testability, flexibility,
                        interoperability, reusability and portability. The matrix considered by this author includes
                        product
                        revision (testing), product transition (adaptation to changes) and product operations (user
                        experience).</p>

                        <strong>
                            Please answer the following questions:


                        </strong>
                    </p>

                    <p> Why do you think that so many frameworks have evolved around the concept of quality metric
                        definition?</p>

                    <p>As the quality can be relative, the models evolve to cover the relativity and the dynamism of the
                        characteristics that define quality. Measuring the quality is the ultimate way of determining if
                        the
                        quality of the product or service matches the expectations of the stakeholders. This way, the
                        models
                        can be more precise and help managers manage the quality of a project more accurately.</p>

                    <p>Which one is the current one?</p>

                    <p>As it is constantly updated, the EFQM is the currently most recognised management framework to
                        support quality (EFQM, N.D.).</p>

                    <p>Which one(s) is applicable to agile methodologies?</p>

                    <p>EFQM allows the continuation of Agile practices, as the processes are continuously analysed and
                        optimised (Mooncamp, 2022). Agile can also integrate into ISO 9001.</p>

                    <p>Which one do you consider to be the most suitable, and why?</p>
                    <p>EFQM is globally recognised; its newest version is 2020, which means it is permanently updated.
                        It
                        is based on five enablers that are very important: leadership, policy and strategy, people,
                        partnership and resources, and processes. It is based on simple but powerful logic. It allows us
                        to
                        drive performance and, at the same time, remain agile, adaptive and able to evolve (EFQM, N.D.).
